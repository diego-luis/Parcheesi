# Parcheesi
This is a graphical and text based recreation of the classic board game Parcheesi.

 The Game is played by four players. The order of which is: Player One (Blue), Player Two (Yellow), Player Three (Green), Player Four (Red)

The rules are:
  1. Draw Dices ( The order of the dices used to move is: 1st left dice, 2nd right dice. Unless the right dice == 5 and left dice != 5.
  2. If a Die is 5 or both total 5 the player may draw a Piece if there are Pieces left on Start. ( A propmt will appear on the window to choose Spawn or Move a Piece.)
  3. Select which piece to move using the boxes with the numbers: (upper left = 1, upper right = 2, lower left = 3, lower right = 4).
     (The path of the Pieces is around the board through the straight line towards HOME with the corresponding color.)
  4. The Piece cannot move if the next spot is a Safe Spot and there is another Piece in it.
  5. If the Piece lands on a spot where another piece is, the piece being landed on returns to its start.
  6. The first Player to get all pieces to HOME wins.
